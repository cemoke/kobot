Important Notes not to forget

R&B Board and Arduino cannot handle 100 KHz I2C
RPI does not support clock stretching thus we need to
decrease comm. speed in order to get rid of problems
40 KHz seems to be working without problems

# Add following lines to the /boot/config.txt

# enable i2c and set its baud rate to 40KHz
dtparam=i2c_arm=on
